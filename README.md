# Full Stack Developer Internship - Technical Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to the second stage of the interview process for the Full Stack Developer Internship! This challenge is designed to assess your abilities in creating full-stack applications. You will be working with a backend API built with Flask that provides weather data for various locations. Additionally, there is a basic Flask application framework for the front end. This challenge is your opportunity to showcase your skills in web development, API integration, and creative problem-solving.

## Objective

Your task is to create a web application that utilizes the provided weather API to display weather data for selected locations. You have the flexibility to use the provided front-end Flask app as a base or to start from scratch with a framework of your choice. The key is to build a functional, user-friendly application that effectively presents the weather data.

### Goals:

- Integrate with the provided Flask weather API.
- Develop a front-end application that displays weather data for user-selected locations.
- Ensure the application is user-friendly and presents the data in a clear, effective manner.
- You may use any additional libraries or frameworks that you find suitable for this challenge.

## Provided Materials

- **Weather API Documentation**: Located at `weather-api/README.md`, this document provides details on how to interact with the weather API.
- **Basic Front-End Flask App**: Available in the `weather-frontend/` directory. This is a simple starting point for your front-end application.

## Requirements

- **Functionality**: The application must fetch data from the weather API and display it to the user.
- **Documentation**: Include a `DOCUMENTATION.md` file in your repository that explains:
  - Your choice of technologies and frameworks.
  - How to set up and run your application.
  - A brief overview of your application's architecture.
  - Any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
- **Code Quality**: Your code should be clean, well-commented, and follow best practices.

## Submission Guidelines

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Complete the challenge according to the goals and requirements specified above.
3. Ensure your final project is available in your forked repository.
4. Submit your project by emailing the link to your repository to [insert email address here].
5. Be prepared to discuss your design choices, challenges, and learnings during a follow-up interview.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality**: Does the application meet the functional requirements?
- **Code Quality**: Is the code well-structured, commented, and easy to understand?
- **User Interface**: Is the application user-friendly and visually appealing?
- **Documentation**: Is the project and its architecture well-documented?
- **Innovation**: Creative solutions and use of technologies.

Good luck! We are excited to see what you create.
